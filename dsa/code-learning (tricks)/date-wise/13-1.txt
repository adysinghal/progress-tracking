doing coding ninjas array problems that most companies asked (ranking)

// maximum subaaray sum

    dp is a good approach when you can pick non continguous elements too
    for contiguous elements -> O(N) linear approach
    with every pass -> update maxi value and also reset sum to 0 if it gets negative

// search in rotated array

    we need to solve in O(logn)
    search for pivot with binary search
    do a binary search in rotated array
