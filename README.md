# My Coding Journey

This repository is a reflection of my dedication to mastering various programming concepts, including Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Machine Learning (ML), and Web Development. Here, I document and share all my coding exercises, solutions, and projects as I progress through my learning path.

## Repository Structure

- **dsa**: Contains solutions to various DSA problems, categorized by topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, and searching algorithms.
  - `arrays/`
  - `linked_lists/`
  - `trees/`
  - `graphs/`
  - `sorting_and_searching/`
  - `miscellaneous/`

  
- **react, react-course**: Contains my web development projects and exercises, covering both front-end and back-end development

## Dependencies

Each project or exercise may have its own set of dependencies. Refer to the specific `README` files or documentation within each directory for detailed setup instructions and required dependencies.

## Acknowledgements
